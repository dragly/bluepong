This is a very simple pong-like game for any device with the Bluez Bluetooth libraries and Python. It is intended as a time killer on Maemo/MeeGo devices.

To play the game, make sure the devices are paired using your Bluetooth configuration.
When paired, run

python bluepong.py

on two devices. On the first device select "Host Game". On the second device select "Join Game" and then select the device which is hosting the game.

Enjoy!
